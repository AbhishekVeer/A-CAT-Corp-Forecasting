A CAT Corp Forecasting-https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/W13377-PDF-ENG

**Background:** 

The company A-CAT corporation is leading producer of electrical appliances in India catering to household use for rural segments. It has its manufacturing units in Gonda town Vidarbha region in Maharashtra. The company offers various electrical appliances such as voltage regulators (flagship product), TV signal boosters, electronic ballasts, battery chargers and FM radio kits.

**Basic Issue:**

A-CAT's voltage regulator sales are dropping despite consistent orders. The issue is two-fold: supply chain problems and limited resources. They rely on a single supplier with long lead times (1 week), and erratic ordering strains that supplier. Supplier complains about the haphazard manner of placing orders. Bulk ordering ties up cash, limiting purchases of parts for other products. These challenges, combined with market conditions and economic uncertainties, threaten A-CAT's ability to address multiple operational and financial issues effectively.

**Problem Statement:**

Developed a strategic plan to optimize transformer procurement by implementing accurate forecasting techniques. This plan aims to ensure timely and appropriately sized orders, preventing both understocking and overstocking scenarios for A-CAT Corporation's transformers which are major part of electrical appliances such as voltage regulators and refrigerators.
